For this project I have the four List files (List.java, Node.java, ArrayList.java and LinkedList.java)
all in the src directory, but you're gonna need to download the test files and place them in the src
directory in order to run the tests.

Also my complexity analysis is in the same folder containing this README (project 3 directory).
