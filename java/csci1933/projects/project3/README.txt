For this project I have the four List files (List.java, Node.java, ArrayList.java and LinkedList.java)
all in the src directory, but you're gonna need to download the test files and place them in the src
directory in order to run the tests.

Also my complexity analysis is in the same folder containing this README (project 3 directory).

Once the all the testing files are in the src directory, you can just use intelliJ and click on the first
upper green circle thing for the LinkedListTest file and the ArrayListTest file to make sure all the 
tests are passed (but I'm sure you already know this but I don't really know what to put in this README).
