Overview</h1>
<p>This is the overview of the image processing library. This image processing library enables our drone to take pictures and analyze them. The core class of the image processing library is the <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="The main class for Image. Image is represented as a big unsigned character array, and alters values i...">Image</a> class. This class contains a pointer of data that represents a 4-channel image, the ordering of the data is in the RGBA format. From this image class, the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> class is used to apply transformations to the image, and these can be used for practical purposes. The image library is also integrated with OpenCV to enable more complex behavior in some filters.</p>
<p>An important idea of the image processing library is the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> class. This is an abstract class that has one Apply function. This “Apply” function will take all the Images in its input and run a filter algorithm on them and put the outputs in its output vector. Filters can be broken up into 2 main categories, there are SimpleFilters and ConvolutionFilters, there are also miscellaneous filters that do not fit into either category.</p>
<p>The <a class="el" href="classSimpleFilter.html" title="The main class for SimpleFilter, extends Filter. This filter does the brunt of the work when iteratin...">SimpleFilter</a>, takes an image and applies some transformation on 1 pixel at a time and this transformation is the same for every pixel. A <a class="el" href="classConvolutionFilter.html" title="The main class for ConvolutionFilter, extends Filter. A basic convolution filter implementation. Each child class will have it&#39;s own kernel object and run the given apply kernel function. This class has a lot of extendability as long as the filter algorithm is the same. ">ConvolutionFilter</a> applies a kernel to every pixel of the image. This kernel tells the filter what to do with the neighboring pixels to create a transformation. These two filter types allow the image processor to have a simple <a class="el" href="classCannyEdgeDetect.html" title="The main class for CannyEdgeDetect, extends Filter.

The <a class="el" href="classCannyEdgeDetect.html" title="The main class for CannyEdgeDetect, extends Filter. This basically just applies each of the filters r...">CannyEdgeDetect</a> filter is one of the image processors most powerful functions. Looking at the UML diagram for the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> class will show how all functionality from this library derives from that class.</p>
<p>Another really powerful use for the image processor, is the OpenCV integration. The BlobDetectorAdapter class is a very powerful filter that uses OpenCV. It uses OpenCV contours and a morphology algorithm to locate the orange robot in the simulation. This functionality would be very complex to implement with the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> and <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="The main class for Image.

OpenCV is not used outside of this class, and any class that does OpenCV should stick with the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> class format and use the adapter design pattern to implement functionality.</p>
<p>From the UML diagram, it is seen that the <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> class and <a class="el" href="classImage.html" title="The main class for Image. Image is represented as a big unsigned character array, and alters values i...">Image</a> class do not interact outside of the Apply function. This is important. An image should not have any reference to any filters, and filters should not have any images as member variables.</p>

How to Contribute</h1>
<p>If a developer wishes to add to our image processing library the process is easy to catch onto. The only extensions that the image processing library accepts is the creation of new filters. First the developer must decide what filter they would like to implement. From there it must be decided if this filter is a <a class="el" href="classSimpleFilter.html" title="The main class for SimpleFilter, extends Filter. This filter does the brunt of the work when iteratin...">SimpleFilter</a> or <a class="el" href="classConvolutionFilter.html" title="The main class for ConvolutionFilter, extends Filter. A basic convolution filter implementation. Each child class will have it&#39;s own kernel object and run the given apply kernel function. This class has a lot of extendability as long as the filter algorithm is the same. ">ConvolutionFilter</a>. The new filter then must extend one of those two classes to use their apply function. However, sometimes a filter is more complex and can simply extend <a class="el" href="classFilter.html" title="The main class for Filter. This is where all the filters are derived from. ">Filter</a> if it gains no benefit from extending any other filter class. The process is then just implanting the Apply function to work on the vector of inputs and adding to the vector of outputs. </p>
