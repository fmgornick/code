class \hyperlink{classSobelFilter}{Sobel\+Filter}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The main class for \hyperlink{classSobelFilter}{Sobel\+Filter}, extends \hyperlink{classFilter}{Filter}. For this filter, instead of outputing two separate images and pushing them onto the \hyperlink{classImage}{Image} $\ast$ vector, we instead chose to double the size of the image and put the image intensity on top and image gradient on bottom. Both image outputs are found by first applying 2 kernels for x and y intensity. The intensity gradient is found by taking the hypotenuse of of each pixel, and the direction gradient is found by taking the arctangent.
