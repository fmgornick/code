\label{classiLogger}\index{i\+Logger@{i\+Logger}}


data logger interface. Used to log data on our drone for reasons unbenounced to me. If we wanted to further optimize our drone search and rescue system, we could use a machine learning algorithm to go through our data output files to find the optimal search pattern. This is a composite pattern and has two main logger methods. One for outputing to the terminal screen, and one for saving in a C\+SV file.
