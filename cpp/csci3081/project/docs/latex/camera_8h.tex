\subsection*{Classes}
\begin{DoxyCompactItemize}
\item 
class \hyperlink{classCamera}{Camera}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The camera class. This class can be attached to any entity and act as a camera. When attached to the web app observer, it can receive pictures from the simulation and process the contents of them and return Camera\+Results. \end{DoxyCompactList}\item 
struct \hyperlink{structCamera_1_1CameraResult}{Camera\+::\+Camera\+Result}
\begin{DoxyCompactList}\small\item\em The struct that holds all the information for the camera results once, image processing is completed. \end{DoxyCompactList}\end{DoxyCompactItemize}
