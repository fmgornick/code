 \section*{Section 1.4 Question 3}
 Find the general solution: $\frac{dy}{dt} = 1 - t + y^2 - ty^2$.

 \section*{Section 1.5 Question 12}
 given $\frac{dp}{dt} = bp^2 - ap, \quad a,b > 0$, show that 
 $p(t)$ approaches $0$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$ if $p_0 < a/b$.

 \section*{Section 1.8 Question 13}
 Find the orthogonal trajectory: $y^2 - x^2 = c$.

 \section*{Section 1.8 Question 18}
 $y(t)$ = number of living bacteria at time $t$. \\

 $T(t)$ = number of toxins at time $t$. \\
 Also, production of toxins begin at time $t=0$, so $T(0) = 0$. \\

 Finally, $\frac{dT}{dt} = c$.

 \begin{enumerate}[label=(\alph*)]

   \item \textbf{Find a first-order differential equation satisfied by $y(t)$}

     $\frac{dy}{dt} = $ (bacteria birth) - (bacteria death). \\
     Bacteria grows proportionally to the amount present $y$ with a proportionality 
     constant $b$. \\
     Bacteria dies proportionally to both the amount present $y$ and the number of 
     toxins present $T$.  The proportionality constant for bacteria death is $a$. \\
     Therefore, $\frac{dy}{dt} \propto y - yT = by - ayT = y(b - aT)$. \\

   \item \textbf{Solve the differential equation to obtain $y(t)$. What happens to
     $y(t)$ as $t \rightarrow \infty$?}

     First let's find $T(t)$...
     $$\frac{dT}{dt} = c \Rightarrow T(t) = \int c \; dt = ct + C$$
     Since $T(0) = 0$, we know $C = 0$, so $T(t) = ct$.  Now we can plug this into
     our equation for $\frac{dy}{dt}$.

     $$\frac{dy}{dt} = y(b-aT) = y(b-act) \Rightarrow \int \frac{dy}{y}
     = \int (b-act) \; dt \Rightarrow \ln{|y(t)|} = bt - \frac{1}{2}act^2 + C_1$$

     Ultimately giving us... 
     $$\mathlarger{\mathlarger{\mathlarger{y(t) = Ce^{bt - \frac{1}{2}act^2}}}}$$

     As $t \rightarrow \infty$, the exponent in the equation is becoming more and 
     more negative.  This is because $-\frac{1}{2}act^2$ is growing much faster than
     $bt$, so the exponent approaches $-\infty$, making the whole equation approach 
     zero.  This basically means that the bacteria is slowly getting wiped out by the
     toxins.

 \end{enumerate}

 \section*{Section 1.10 Question 5}
 Show that the solution $y(t)$ of the initial value problem exists on the given
 interval... 
 $$\mathlarger{\mathlarger{
   y' = y + e^{-y} + e^{-t}, \quad y(0) = 0, \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1
 }}$$.
