\textbf{What does this source tell you that would be obvious, as it relates to your question?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The creation of the steam powered railway lead to 6000 miles of track being laid down in only 26 years.
    \item Horses were used to pull coal carts on tram lines out of mines for carriage to London.  This was before the development of the steam engine.
    \item Since the Watt steam engine was so heavy, it didn't take over the industry for a while, as the cost to use the engine outweighed the profit from the transported coal.

\textbf{What does this source tell you that may not be as obvious?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It was the development of the high-pressure steam engine that sparked the widespread use of machinery in place of horses for tasks such as moving coal.
    \item Even after the development of the high pressure steam engine, horses were still an important factor in the growth of Great Britain.
