\textbf{The story this article tells:} Similar to my question, this article talks about the importance of horses during, and even after the industrial revolution.  But this article mainly focuses on the aspect of the brewing industry, and less so of the general role of the horse over this period.  The article sheds light on the fact that even with machinery that outperforms horses in certain jobs, new roles become available.  The topic of the horse's role in the brewing industry in Hanoverian London serves as a microcosm for my topic of how the role of the horse changed due to the industrial revolution.  One point in the paper is that when the mill-horse was replaced by machine, beer sales went up (because the steam engine made production more efficient), so dray horses were used much more as transportation.
