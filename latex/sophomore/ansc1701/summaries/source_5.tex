\textbf{The story this book excerpt tells:} From what I can gather from this excerpt is that, even if the steam engine took over in certain roles, it wasn't an abrupt change like most people would initially think.  Even with the creation of the Watt steam engine, it was still nowhere near being more cost efficient than horses.  The steam engine at simply didn't have the power output to justify it's weight.  It was because of this reason that horses were still used heavily until later improvements in technology.  So in this case, the industrial revolution did ultimately shift jobs from horses to machinery, but this change took much longer than people think, and the horse wasn't really effected until decades later when improvements in technology made machinery a more viable choice.
