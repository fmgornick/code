\textbf{The story this book excerpt tells:} This article compares the cost of using horses vs machinery for railway work.  As the industrial revolution brought forth the steam engine, it became a matter of whether or not the investment of one was worth it.  Especially in it's early stages, the steam engine wasn't nearly as efficient as it is today, so horses were still used for quite a while after the industrial revolution for tasks such as railway work.  The most obvious example from this excerpt explaining this story would be the list of expenses for both the horse and steam engine.  But overall this excerpt basically proves that horses were still quite the necessity even decades after the industrial revolution.
