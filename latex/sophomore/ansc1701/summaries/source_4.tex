\textbf{The story this graph tells:} The message is pretty simple, this graph displays the total horse stock over time, and also shows the two contributors, mill horses and dray horses.  As you can see, mill horses contributed to a decent portion of horse stock in the Truman brewing industry back in 1790, but with the development of the steam engine, that population slowly declined.  Around the same time the mill horse population decreased, we see that the dray horse population increased to the point where the entirety of the Truman horse stock was made up of dray horses.  This change in horse stock coincides with the improvement of efficiency of the steam engine.  In this specific case, Truman Brewery's total horse stock actually increased at the same time the steam engine took over the milling process, so it can be reasonably deduced that in this specific case, the industrial revolution actually supplied more jobs for horses.
