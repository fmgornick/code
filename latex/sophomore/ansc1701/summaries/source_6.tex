\textbf{The story this image tells:} This image isn't really trying to convey any message similar to my topic, but I believe it does indirectly relate.  Since the NYC fire department's start in 1865 (long after the industrial revolution's end), horses have been a huge factor in saving the lives of many people.  Horses were used for quick inner-city travel of firemen even decades after the department's inception.  So this image displays another valuable role that horses serve post-industrialization.  Now although at this point, horses have been replaced by our modern-day firetrucks, this is just one of many examples of horse's finding new ways to benefit our community.  Even now horses continue to help us in ways we would have never imagined in the past.
