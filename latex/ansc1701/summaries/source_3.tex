\textbf{The story this painting tells:} This painting's primary purpose was to shed light on what it's like in the London Brewing Industries back in the late 1700s. As to how it relates to my topic of the horses' role after the industrial revolution, this paints a pretty clear picture.  Context of the time tells us that the mill-horse's replacement with the steam engine lead to more horses being used to cart around barrels of beer.  Therefore the horse depicted in this painting is, in part, a consequence of the industrial revolution. Some clues in the painting that indicate this story would obviously be the horse being backed into a dray, some of the barrels of beer you can see in the background, and also the title of the painting "Whitbread Brewery in Chiswell street".  One minor detail that may indirectly show the steam engine taking over the original milling job of the horse would be the smoke clouds in the background.
