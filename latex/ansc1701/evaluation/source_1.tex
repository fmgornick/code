\textbf{What does this source tell you that would be obvious, as it relates to your question?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Animals, especially horses, played an important role during the industrial revolution.
    \item The economy of the UK metropolitan area is very dependent on the use of horses in industries such as brewing and alcohol distribution.
    \item Industrial revolution actually led to an increased use of horses in urban cities rather than the expected decrease.

\textbf{What does this source tell you that may not be as obvious?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The article is pretty clear in what information it displays to the reader without much room for interpretation, but going off just the abstract, there's plenty to learn.
    \item One example is how the industrial revolution actually increased the importance of the horse.  The abstract states that the reliance on horses increased, but failed to mention that it came as a result of the steam engine shifting the jobs of brewing  horses from processing grain, to distributing the finished product.
