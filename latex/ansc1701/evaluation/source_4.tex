\textbf{What does this source tell you that would be obvious, as it relates to your question?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item graph is pretty straightforward, showing population of total horse stock for Truman Brewing over time.
    \item Mill-Horse population dropped slowly, but at the same time, the Dray horse population shot up.
    \item Total horse stock actually increased.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{What does this source tell you that may not be as obvious?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item similar to Source 3, this source fails to mention the reason behind this drastic change in horse population.
    \item Development of the steam engine replaced the use of mill-horses in the task of processing grains, but this new efficiency boost required more dray horses to cart the excess booze around the city.
\end{itemize}
