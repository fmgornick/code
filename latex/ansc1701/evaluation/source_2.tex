\textbf{What does this source tell you that would be obvious, as it relates to your question?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Both horses and primitive steam engines come at a high cost.
    \item Depending on the use case, one of the two is most likely preferable.
    \item Just because the steam engine was a new invention at the time, doesn't mean necessarily that it's better choice, especially since it was very ineffective at processing the coal it runs on efficiently.

\end{itemize}

\textbf{What does this source tell you that may not be as obvious?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item This whole book is about horses and doesn't really bring up the steam engine in many other pages, so some of the pro-horse bias may be less obvious.
    \item The author mentions this in another page, but the engine needs to be in constant rapid movement to be working efficiently, so any small obstruction can completely halt the process.
\end{itemize}
