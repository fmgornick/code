\textbf{What does this source tell you that would be obvious, as it relates to your question?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The painting shows a draft horse being backed into a dray.
    \item The barrels in the background could indicate that the horse is transporting some kind of liquor.
    \item It can be deduced by the buildings and muggy clouds that this painting depicts some area in Great Britain.  Also, this painting is from London, so that's another giveaway.
    \item Most likely, anyone would assume that the horse in this city landscape is being used for work in transporting some sort of goods. \\
\end{itemize}

\textbf{What does this source tell you that may not be as obvious?}
\begin{itemize}
    \item It may not be 100\% obvious that this horse is transporting liquor, as the barrels are in the background and could also contain a number of things.
    \item This picture takes place in the middle of the industrial revolution.
    \item Knowing the era of this painting actually tells a lot about this specific scene.  Since the steam engine outperformed horses in the task of brewing the liquor, the demand for horses actually jumped at this time because they were needed for the city-wide transportation of the liquor.
    \item With the knowledge in the previous point, it can be reasonably inferred that a scene of a horse being backed into a dray was actually quite common around the time.
