# CSCI 4131 Assignment 6
## Information
- x500: gorni025
- acc_login: fmgornick
- acc_password: DrDanIsDaddy

## Dependencies
just in case you don't wan't spend the time typing out all the `npm install` commands

- express
- mysql
- url
- body-parser
- bcrypt
- express-session
- express-handlebars

you can install them all at the same time with the following command
```
npm i express mysql url body-parser bcrypt express-session express-handlebars
```
the express-handlebars package gives a warning about vulnerabilities, but it's the only package I could use that allowed me to notify the user when login fails, and since i'm not using this website for anything important i figured it's no big deal
