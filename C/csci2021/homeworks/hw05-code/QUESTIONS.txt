PROBLEM 1: C Bit Operations in Collatz
======================================

  Examine the program collatz.c which performs a similar computation to
  a HW01 code except that this version uses bitwise operations in the
  function collatz_bitwise().  Examine the locations labeled with
  comments and shown below and describe the equivalent "normal"
  arithmetic that is happening at each postion.


A
~

  ,----
  |   int neg_mask = 0x1 << 31;     // A
  |   if(n & neg_mask){             // A
  |     return -1;
  |   }
  `----
  checks if the number is positive or negative


B
~

  ,----
  |     if(n & 0x1){                // B
  |       ...
  |     }
  |     else{
  |       ...
  |     }
  `----
  checks if n is odd


C
~

  ,----
  |       n = ((n << 2) - n) + 1;   // C
  `----
  if n is odd, multiply by 3 and add 1


D
~

  ,----
  |       n = n >> 1;               // D
  `----
  else, divide n by 2


PROBLEM 2: C Union and Float Bits
=================================

A
~

  Compile and run union.c to see what floating point value is printed by
  the lines.
  ,----
  |   flint.in = 0xC378C000;        // assign an int value
  |   printf("%.4f\n",flint.fl);    // print as a float value
  `----
  Show the float value and explain why it has a well-defined value
  despite no assignment of `flint.fl = ...;' appearing.

  although no value was assigned to the float field, it's a union, meaning that
  the int that was assigned is overlayed on top of the same memory location.  
  so the compiler reads the int as a float

B
~

  The subsequent loop
  ,----
  |   flint.in = 0xC378C000;        // assign an int value
  |   ...
  |   for(int i=0; i<4; i++){       // print chars individually
  |     unsigned char c = flint.ch[i];
  |     printf("%d: %02x '%c'\n", i,c,c);
  |   }
  `----
  prints values of the bytes associated with `flint' as chars and
  hexadecimal numbers.  Show its output and explain why the hex digits
  appear in a different order from the constant flint is set to
  initially.

  the computer must be little endian, meaning the least significant bit holds
  the lowest memory address


C
~

  The lines
  ,----
  | int mask = ~(0x80000000);
  | flint.in = flint.in & mask;
  | printf("%.4f\n",flint.fl);
  `----
  modify flint again. Show the resulting floating point output and
  describe why it has the shown value.

  248.7500.  This is because in the IEEE floating point format, the most 
  significant bit contains the sign of the number.  It was originally a 1, so
  the number was negative, but the hex number 0x80000000 is a 1 followed by 31
  0s in binary.  The inverse of that is a 0 followed by 31 1s, which is what
  the tilde does.  So now it uses the bitwise and (&) to match the 2 numbers. 
  This results in the whole number being the same, except the most significant
  bit (the sign indicator) is switched to a zero if it wasn't already.  So now
  the number is unsigned.


PROBLEM 3: GDB
==============

A debug_scramble.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The file debug_scramble.c has a short problem which requires the
  correct number to be given as a command line argument. An array is
  filled with values and then scrambled. The command line must
  correspond to the "positive" response. Due to the array scrambling it
  is not apparent from the source code which array location contains the
  positive response.

  Use the debugger to determine the location the positive response.  For
  each of the steps below, write the commands to issue to do the items
  listed.
  1. Compile debug_scramble.c with debug symbols turned on
  2. Start gdb with the resulting program
  3. Set the arguments of the program to just 0
  4. Set a breakpoint at a line in debug_scramble.c after the scramble
     loop
  5. Run the program
  6. Print out the array after stopping at the breakpoint
  7. Locate the positive response
  8. Change the program arguments so that it is the correct index
  9. Re-run the program and continue to the end


B debug_long.c
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

  The file debug_long.c has another short debugging problem.  It
  requires an input string which is interpreted similarly to a
  demonstration code at the top of code.  The correct input will elicit
  the affirmative response.

  To determine the correct input take the following approach.
  1. Break after setting the variable `lng' to its large, mysterious
     value
  2. Print the bytes of long NOT as a number but interpreted as an array
     of characters (string). This can be done in `gdb' by coercing the
     types as in:
     ,----
     | gdb> print (char []) varname
     `----
  3. This should shed light on the correct input.
