Hashset Application
Commands:
  hashcode <item>  : prints out the numeric hash code for the given key (does not change the hash set)
  contains <item>  : prints the value associated with the given item or NOT PRESENT
  add <item>       : inserts the given item into the hash set, reports existing items
  print            : prints all items in the hash set in the order they were addded
  structure        : prints detailed structure of the hash set
  clear            : reinitializes hash set to be empty with default size
  save <file>      : writes the contents of the hash set to the given file
  load <file>      : clears the current hash set and loads the one in the given file
  next_prime <int> : if <int> is prime, prints it, otherwise finds the next prime and prints it
  expand           : expands memory size of hash set to reduce its load factor
  bye              : exit the program
