CSCI 5103 Assignment 5

all test cases worked fine on our VMs

the start up for each test takes a bit because the producer does a sleep for 10 
seconds to give other processes time to open the timedbuffer but i figured it'd 
be best not to touch any files other than main.c.

terminal prompt seems to always pop up once the consumer exits, so if the producer 
doesn't exit until it times out from a full buffer, the producer exit prompt will
show up after the terminal prompt is already back which is kinda wacky.

no special instructions, i didn't really touch anything outside of the 4 functions 
in main.c, so it should run with the basic:

1 - make
2 - sudo ./buffer_load
3 - ./testcase.sh [1,2,3]
4 - sudo ./buffer_unload
