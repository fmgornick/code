  - from hear on, every step should be done in the Part-1 directory


COMPILE

  to compile, simply run: make

  - this will output a part1.o object file and a part1 executable as well as 
    create a log directory.  We will only need the executable for the 
    following steps

RUN

  you can run the code with: ./part1 <num_items>

  - <num_items> simply represents the number of items you want each producer to 
    add to our bounded buffer.  Leaving this flag empty, or failing to provide 
    an integer argument will result in the program defaulting the value of 
    <num_items> to 100

  - when this program finishes executing, you should have four new files 
    in the newly created log directory: producer_red.log,  producer_white.log,  
    producer_blue.log, and consumer.log.  You can check that each file 
    contains the correct output yourself

CLEAN

  to restore this directory to just part1.c, Makefile, and this README, you can 
  run: make clean

  - This will remove the log directory, our object file, as well as our executable.
