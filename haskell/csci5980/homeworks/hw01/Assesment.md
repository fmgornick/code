# Self Assessment - Fletcher Gornick

## Questions

#### Q1: what parts of this assignment were easy for you?
**A1:** the simple functions outlined in `introduction.hs` were pretty easy to understand.  Although the fold function was tough to understand at first, it became much easier as i got used to it.

#### Q2: what parts where more challenging?
**A2:** everything was pretty straightforward and i didn't really have too much trouble with much.  I even prefer the syntax in Haskell.  One thing though was in part 5 where we needed to use a tree reduce function, i was a little unsure of whether or not we needed to make one, or how it should be made.

#### Q3: were there any parts that you were not able to complete?
**A3:** not for this assignment, although it was pretty intense for a first assignment so i am a little worried about future assignments.  Also i'm not 100% sure if i wrote the reduce function correctly, but i'm pretty sure i at least called them properly.

## Conclusion
Overall, this assignment went pretty well.  It's pretty fun writing these small functions and seeing how you can minimize the code and make it all look pretty.  Every function i wrote was pretty much just a matter of splitting it up into 2 or 3 cases and writing one line of code for each case.

Haskell is a really cool language, and i feel like it comes much more natural to me than other languages because i can think about functions as if i'm writing a sort of mathematical proof.  I didn't do any extensive testing on any of my functions, but they matched the example outputs first try once i got them working so i assume everything is at least correct.  I'm sure there's a few other things i could have done to make a neater or faster solution but it's only my first week so i'm not too worried.
